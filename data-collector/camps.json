It's tended by an eclectic group of coyote-adjacent artists to increase coyote consciousness by showing these canines in different lights.﻿ Coyote Garden exists outside of known time and space. It appears out of the ether on very special occasions when the colorful progenitor coyotes are summoned to this realm by the secret rituals and dark science of the mysterious Coyote Gardeners. The interdimensional coyotes are especially active from dusk till dawn, when the garden fully transforms and reveals its truest form. Sometimes pancakes and coffee appear too.",
